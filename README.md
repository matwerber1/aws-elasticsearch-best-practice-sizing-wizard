# Amazon Elasticsearch Size Wizard

This project provides a Github.io React App that walks you through some Amazon Elasticsearch (ES) sizing and configuration best practices. 

Ultimately, there's no perfect answer for proper ES config and finding the right solution will require trial and error. Hopefully, this project can at least help point you in the right direction.

## Disclaimer

As of this writing (Jan 2020), I am fairly new to ES. I will provide citations for my recommendations, but please fact check them to confirm I'm interpreting them correctly and that they are still up-to-date. 

Update - Mar 2020 - I saw a squirrel and started working on other things. This guide is incomplete, but maybe gives at least a few useful tips?
